## Overview

Payent is a peer-to-peer tech-gear rental marketplace. The product centers on renting premium devices and accessories from verified lenders, with customer-facing browsing, checkout, and account flows plus an admin console for operational oversight.

The current codebase is a working prototype rather than a fully production-hardened platform. It mixes real backend routes, local persistence, mock storefront data, and experimental ML modules. That mix is useful for evolution planning but it must be understood before making structural changes.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

The frontend stack is built around React 19, TanStack Start, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix and shadcn-style UI primitives, Vite 8, and TypeScript 5. The repo also uses a large component library layer and a custom utility layer for search, analytics, storage, and auth.

### Backend

The backend is a FastAPI service served by uvicorn or gunicorn. Data access uses PyMySQL with raw SQL and no ORM. Authentication uses JWT and bcrypt, with Twilio and Razorpay integrations wired into the API surface.

### Deployment Model

The application is configured for production hosting using the Vercel ➔ Railway ➔ TiDB Cloud ➔ Razorpay Verified Webhooks architecture:

- **Frontend Site (`payent-frontend`)**: React 19 / Vite SPA deployed on Vercel with `vercel.json` SPA rewrite rules mapping `/*` to `index.html`.
- **Backend Service (`payent-backend`)**: FastAPI ASGI web service deployed on Railway via `railway.json` / `backend/Dockerfile` with health probe checks at `/api/health`.
- **Datastore**: TiDB Cloud (Serverless/Dedicated MySQL-compatible database with SSL connection pooling).
- **Payment Gateway**: Razorpay HMAC-SHA256 signature verified webhooks (`/api/payments/webhook`).
- **Documentation**: See `docs/deployment-guide.md` for step-by-step setup details.

## Repository Layout

The main areas are:

- `src/` for the customer-facing frontend application.
- `backend/` for the FastAPI service and its supporting modules.
- `src/admin/` for the separate admin app experience.
- `docs/` for documentation and design notes.
- `vercel.json` and `railway.json` at the repository root for platform deployment.

A few repository facts matter for planning:

- `rentwise-pro-main/` duplicate snapshot has been removed as part of Phase 1.
- Render hosting blueprints (`render.yaml` and `docs/render-deployment.md`) have been removed and replaced with `vercel.json`, `railway.json`, and `docs/deployment-guide.md`.
- `scratch/` directory and `scratch/update_catalog.py` orphaned maintenance script have been removed.
- `requirements.txt` dependencies at repository root are synchronized with `backend/requirements.txt` (including `firebase-admin`, `razorpay`, `twilio`).

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend uses TanStack file-based routing. Route definitions live in `src/routes/`, the app shell is defined in `src/routes/__root.tsx`, and route bootstrap is handled in `src/router.tsx`.

The app uses two main layouts:

- `src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx` provides the standard public shell with the navbar and footer.
- `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx` provides the authenticated dashboard shell with the navbar and sidebar.
- `src/components/auth/AuthLayout.tsx` is used for auth-facing screens.

Page transitions are driven by the **Origin-Based Expanding Reveal Transition** engine (`src/components/navigation/OriginRevealTransition.tsx`). This system dynamically captures the originating element's bounding box (`getBoundingClientRect()`), animates a soft organic SVG expansion with an ambient luminous glass leading edge, progressively unveils destination content with subtle settle physics (`cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`), and cleans up all mask/filter layers upon completion for unhindered scrolling and zero residual DOM artifacts.

Protected routes are wrapped by `src/components/common/ProtectedRoute.tsx`. The auth state is managed by `useAuth`, wishlist state by `useWishlist`, and theme state by `useTheme`. These hooks read and write browser storage under keys such as `payent:token`, `payent:currentUser`, `payent:wishlist`, `payent:theme`, and the admin-specific `payent:admin:*` values.

Search is split between a live backend path and an offline fallback. `src/utils/smartSearch.ts` calls the backend `POST /api/search`, while `src/utils/searchEngine.ts` provides an offline search engine for fallback and local development. Analytics follow a similar pattern. `src/utils/eventTracker.ts` batches events and sends them to `POST /api/events` so user behavior can be recorded without blocking the UI.

## Backend Architecture

The backend entrypoint in `backend/main.py` groups routes by responsibility:

- Health and root endpoints.
- User auth and account routes.
- User data routes for profile, wishlist, orders, notifications, and custom products.
- Payment routes for order creation, verification, webhook handling, and refund processing.
- Admin auth and admin management routes.
- WebSocket routes for realtime admin updates.
- Recommendation and event ingestion routes.
- Search routes for ML-powered discovery.

Authentication is implemented in `backend/auth.py`. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt and validated for strength, including a live Have I Been Pwned check. JWT tokens are created and decoded with explicit algorithm enforcement, and token revocation is supported through the `token_blocklist` mechanism. Rate limiting is also part of the auth flow to reduce brute-force abuse.

The Razorpay flow is present in the backend but partly disabled. The code supports create-order, verify, webhook, and refund actions. However, the SDK client is disabled with `razorpay_client = None`, and manual HMAC-SHA256 validation is the only active path for signature verification. The commented-out Razorpay block remains a large, legacy implementation artifact that should be reconciled before further payment work.

Data access is handled in `backend/database.py` through raw SQL helpers. The module provides helpers for connection management, query execution, schema initialization, CRUD operations, token revocation, rate limiting, and analytics persistence. It also includes in-memory `MOCK_*` fallbacks so the service can continue functioning during local or degraded environments.

## Admin Panel

The admin experience is a separate frontend surface under `src/admin/`. The admin pages include dashboards, users, agents, products, bookings, payments, reviews, reports, notifications, categories, analytics, settings, profile, support, and activity logs. Each page is paired with a service module under `src/admin/services/`, such as `auth.ts`, `users.ts`, `products.ts`, `payments.ts`, `notifications.ts`, `bookings.ts`, and `websocket.ts`.

The admin API routes in `backend/main.py` are protected by `Depends(check_admin_user)`. That dependency enforces admin-only access before the route can execute. The admin auth client in `src/admin/services/auth.ts` uses separate storage keys, including `payent:admin:token` and `payent:admin:current_user`, and targets the backend endpoint `/api/admin/auth/login`.

The admin panel also includes a WebSocket service in `src/admin/services/websocket.ts` that connects to the backend `/api/admin/ws` channel. The backend uses `broadcast_admin_event` to push admin events such as user updates, booking changes, and payment notifications. The admin API client also contains an offline mock interceptor that allows the admin UI to keep functioning when the backend is unreachable.

## ML Features

The ML layer has two main components.

- `backend/recommendations_ml.py` implements item-based collaborative filtering with cosine similarity. It uses a data-sufficiency gate before computing recommendations and persists similarity data into the `item_similarities` table.
- `backend/search_ml.py` implements TF-IDF indexing, cosine similarity ranking, Levenshtein-based spelling correction, and personalization re-ranking based on user behavior.

These modules are not yet fully integrated into every user journey, but they form the current experimentation boundary for smarter recommendations and search.

## Data Model

The database schema in `backend/database.py` is centered on MySQL tables such as `users`, `orders`, `custom_products`, `reviews`, `reports`, `user_events`, `item_similarities`, and supporting tables for auth, notifications, admin state, and payment records.

There is a notable drift between the frontend type definitions in `src/types/index.ts` and the database schema. The UI types contain fields that are mostly presentation-oriented, while the database schema includes more operational columns such as payment and admin audit data. Some payment fields that appear in the backend are not mirrored in the frontend types, and the current UI model is therefore not a complete representation of the backend contract.

## Integration Status

The project has a mixed integration state. Some customer-facing features are backed by real backend routes, while others are still served by mock storefront data.

## Technical Debt

The main technical debt areas are clear:

- [RESOLVED Phase 1] The duplicate snapshot `rentwise-pro-main/`, `api/index.py`, and `scratch/` orphaned maintenance scripts have been removed.
- [RESOLVED Phase 1] Dependency artifacts consolidated across root `requirements.txt` and `backend/requirements.txt`.
- [RESOLVED Phase 2] The Razorpay SDK client is enabled and active in `backend/main.py` with full order creation, signature verification, webhook handling, and refund endpoints.
- [RESOLVED Phase 2] Hardcoded production defaults for `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` in `backend/config.py` now raise runtime errors in production mode if unset.
- [RESOLVED Phase 2] Removed `src/utils/adminSetup.ts` from client bundle.
- [RESOLVED Phase 2] Removed `mock-admin-token` fallback in `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`.
- [RESOLVED Admin Migration] Built parameterized SQL time-series bucketing (`days` query parameter: 7, 30, 90, 365) for `revenueChart`, `bookingChart`, `userGrowth`, and `productGrowth`.
- [RESOLVED Admin Migration] Replaced hardcoded date strings in `bookingsToday` and `revenueToday` with dynamic parameterized SQL queries (`CURDATE()`). Replaced hardcoded visitor stat with real `user_events` count.
- [RESOLVED Admin Migration] Fixed frontend fallback leaks across `notifications.ts`, `users.ts`, `products.ts`, `bookings.ts`, and `payments.ts` so reachable backends returning empty arrays `[]` render empty states instead of static demo data.
- [RESOLVED Admin Migration] Purged all fake mock users (Priya, Devon, Elena, Marcus) from initial data and local storage fallbacks.
- [RESOLVED Storefront Purge] Removed `mock_prices` and `mock_titles` static dictionary lookups in payment checkout path, replacing them with live database pricing queries against `custom_products`.
- [RESOLVED Storefront Purge] Added public storefront routes `GET /api/categories/public` and `GET /api/stats/public` to FastAPI backend.
- [RESOLVED Storefront Purge] Replaced `src/utils/mockData.ts` usage across all customer-facing routes (`FeaturedProducts`, `ProductDetails`, `Categories`, `Wishlist`, `BecomeLender`, `Checkout`, `Payment`, `About`, `HelpChatbot`) with live API calls.
- [RESOLVED Storefront Purge] Gated Twilio SMS OTP verification so production environments raise errors on failure instead of falling back to mock OTP.
- [RESOLVED Storefront Purge] Purged fake mock product cards (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, `p9`, `p11`) from `mockData.ts` and `backend/database.py` so only real user listings appear in the catalog.
- [RESOLVED Category Reference Cards] Added interactive visual Category Reference Cards for Bikes, Cameras, Laptops, Electronic Drilling Tools, Power Banks, and Drones to `/categories`.
- [RESOLVED Lender Direct Camera & UI] Built live WebRTC camera capture modal (`CameraCaptureModal.tsx`), interactive earnings estimator slider, 3-step guided listing form, multi-photo gallery management, and real-time marketplace product card preview on `/become-lender`.
- [RESOLVED Persistent Products & Deletion Security] Auto-approved new custom products (status: approved, available: true) across backend and client, removed per-user local storage namespacing for customProducts so products are globally shared across all users, and enforced strict owner/admin-only deletion authorization on backend API and ProductCard UI.
- [RESOLVED TiDB Cloud MySQL Migration] Migrated all website data operations (products, custom listings, categories, wishlist, orders, notifications, admin management records) exclusively to TiDB Cloud MySQL via live FastAPI backend endpoints, eliminating localStorage data persistence.
- [RESOLVED Mobile Navigation Redesign] Redesigned mobile navigation layout to floating capsule bottom bar with active pill animations (Home, Browse, Become Lender, Dashboard) active post-login.
- [RESOLVED Deployment Healthcheck & Python 3.12 UTC Datetime] Resolved 1/1 replicas healthcheck deployment failures caused by bare datetime module AttributeError (`datetime.utcnow` -> `dt.now(timezone.utc)`) across `backend/database.py` and `backend/main.py`, synchronized `dbutils` dependency in `backend/requirements.txt`, and ensured database idempotency.
- [RESOLVED Production Reviews Migration] Replaced fake demo reviews (Rahul Mehta, Sneha Iyer, Aditya Varma) and mock testimonials with a secure production review system. Enhanced MySQL `reviews` table with `user_email`, `booking_id`, `is_verified`, `product_image`, `updated_at`, and indexing. Implemented FastAPI review endpoints (`GET /api/reviews`, `GET /api/reviews/stats`, `GET /api/reviews/eligible-bookings`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), strictly validated rental booking eligibility and duplicate review prevention, wired homepage "What Creators Say" to live endpoints with skeleton loaders and empty states, updated "View All Reviews" link to dedicated `/reviews` route, and created `/reviews` page with live statistical aggregations and verified authoring modal.
- [RESOLVED Session Expiry & Auto-Refresh] Added automatic token refresh mutex with proactive expiry detection, Axios response interceptor for 401 recovery, and server-side token blocklist verification (`is_session_revoked`).
- [RESOLVED Profile Camera & Identity Management] Built live WebRTC camera capture modal (`CameraPhotoModal.tsx`) with browser permission handling, natural horizontal flip on snapshot capture, live preview, retake, and confirmation. Added "Change Profile Photo" menu with "Take Photo", "Upload Photo", and "Remove Photo" options syncing seamlessly with database and navbar avatar.
- [RESOLVED Admin Manual User Approval] Implemented manual admin verification workflow: new user registrations start in `pending` status. Added `GET /api/admin/users/{id}`, `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/approve`, and `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/reject` endpoints with audit logging in `admin_logs`. Added status filtering (Pending, Approved, Active, Rejected, Suspended) and prominent Approve/Reject action buttons in the admin user roster and details modal. Restricted active rental/listing actions for pending accounts while allowing profile customization.
- [RESOLVED Premium Button Color Redesign] Redesigned primary button system across Light and Dark modes: Light mode uses deep charcoal `#161616` (Hover `#292929`, Pressed `#0B0B0B`) with `#FFFFFF` text; Dark mode uses warm ivory `#F2F0EA` (Hover `#FFFFFF`, Pressed `#DCD9D1`) with `#0A0A0A` text. Enforced clean neutral secondary outline and tertiary styling, reserving brand red `#FF1744` solely for accents and destructive danger actions. Eliminated all teal/cyan/aqua colors from button primitives and gradients.
- [RESOLVED Complete Page Redesign (Browse + About + Contact)] Redesigned Browse, About, and Contact pages to a unified, cinematic, editorial visual language. Browse features compact cinematic header, integrated keyword/location search, dynamic category strip from live backend categories, desktop sticky filter column & mobile sliding drawer, 100% real database products with pagination, skeletons, and empty states. About features cinematic creator hero, authentic 4-part story, typographic mission statement, creator audience showcase, 4-step rental journey, platform security safeguards, and live aggregate stats. Contact features genuine company contact channels, interactive validated inquiry form, and live backend submission to 'POST /api/contact' integrated directly into the Admin Help Desk. All pages adhere strictly to the neutral button system (Light: #161616, Dark: #F2F0EA) and zero-teal/cyan palette.
- [RESOLVED Browse Page Refinement: Dates Removal, Auto-Location Only & Real Lender Availability] Refined the PAYENT Browse experience: (1) Removed rental dates from the Browse search bar and filter drawers, rebalancing search input and controls with natural desktop `flex-1`/`shrink-0` spacing and mobile vertical stacking; (2) Replaced the static city dropdown with automatic geolocation detection (`useUserLocation`), displaying detected location or neutral fallback (`📍 Location unavailable`) with a subtle `↻` re-detect button and nationwide/nearby view toggle; (3) Authoritatively anchored product card availability to real backend MySQL inventory and lender status via single-query SQL `LEFT JOIN users` and `LEFT JOIN agents`, displaying `● Available` with enabled `Add to Cart` or `● Not Available` with disabled button, backed by server-side revalidation on `POST /api/cart` rejecting unavailable items with HTTP 400.
- [RESOLVED Real Profile Statistics, Authentic Messages, Contact Tickets & Multi-Tier Caching] (1) Replaced hardcoded static profile metrics with real database-aggregated queries (`GET /api/profile/stats`, `GET /api/users/me/stats`), calculating completed rentals across renter and lender roles, live review rating averages, on-time return percentages, and response times with honest empty states for untracked metrics (`0 Completed Rentals`, `★ New`, `N/A`, `No data`); (2) Upgraded the Messages experience from fake demo arrays to a real database-backed messaging system (`GET /api/messages`, `GET /api/messages/{id}`, `POST /api/messages/{id}/reply`, `POST /api/messages/new`, `PATCH /api/messages/{id}/read`) backed by MySQL `support_tickets` and `support_ticket_messages` tables with JWT authentication, unread badge tracking, live reply transmission, and new inquiry creation; (3) Connected Contact page submissions (`POST /api/contact`) directly to MySQL tickets and messages, allowing support tickets submitted on `/contact` to immediately appear in the user's `/messages` inbox; (4) Built multi-tier performance caching with TTL-based server caching on safe read-heavy public endpoints (`/api/stats/public`, `/api/categories/public`), user-isolated caching for profile stats (`profile_stats:{user_email}`), automatic cache invalidation on review/booking mutations, TanStack Query caching with stale-while-revalidate, and request deduplication; (5) Enforced strict color palette compliance (zero teal/cyan/aqua) and neutral button system (#161616 light primary, #F2F0EA dark primary).
- [RESOLVED Next-Gen UI, Brand System, App Preloader, User Approval Flow & Cart Overhaul] (1) Built cinematic convergence App Preloader (`AppPreloader.tsx`) featuring 4-quadrant creator gear symbols converging to the canonical Green "P" mark + PAYENT wordmark with fast session caching; (2) Integrated Green "P" LogoIcon across all navbar and sidebar surfaces with strict neutral color hierarchy; (3) Created New User Approval & Waiting Flow (`AccountPending.tsx`, route `/account-pending`) with rotating creator gear icons, live 12s auto-polling of backend `GET /api/auth/status`, and automatic redirect to `/categories` upon administrative approval; (4) Redesigned first-section hero whitespace across About, Browse, and Contact pages with responsive 2-column balanced layouts, live marketplace metrics, and support channels; (5) Overhauled Browse page (`Categories.tsx`) with min/max price range sliders, removal of restrictive location filters in favor of nationwide gear access with local proximity sorting; (6) Streamlined Cart (`useCart.tsx`, `api.ts`, `CartDrawer.tsx`, `Cart.tsx`, `ProductCard.tsx`) to focus purely on products and daily rates (`₹X/day`), moving date picking and duration calculation strictly to the checkout stage; (7) Verified full responsive image scaling on mobile viewports with zero layout breakage.
- [RESOLVED Peer-to-Peer Rental Chat & Live GPS Delivery Tracking System] (1) Implemented real-time booking-linked chat system (`/api/bookings/{id}/conversation`, `/api/conversations/{id}`, `/api/conversations/{id}/messages`, `/api/conversations/{id}/read`, and WebSocket `/api/conversations/{id}/ws`) backed by MySQL `conversations` and `conversation_messages` tables with JWT authentication, counterparty notification alerts, unread counts, and strict IDOR access control; (2) Built live GPS delivery tracking system (`/api/bookings/{id}/delivery`, `/api/deliveries/{id}/tracking`, `/api/deliveries/{id}/status`, `/api/deliveries/{id}/location`, `/api/deliveries/{id}/confirm`, and WebSocket `/api/deliveries/{id}/ws`) with 6-stage milestone state machine (`PENDING` -> `PREPARING` -> `READY` -> `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` -> `NEAR_DESTINATION` -> `DELIVERED`), Haversine distance calculations, dynamic ETA estimations, GPS breadcrumb history in `delivery_locations`, customer delivery receipt confirmation, and post-delivery location privacy shutdown; (3) Developed responsive customer tracking frontend (`DeliveryTracking.tsx`, `/delivery/$id`) featuring dynamic OpenStreetMap/Leaflet visualization, live route breadcrumbs, milestone stepper, realtime WebSocket auto-reconnect, and one-click receipt confirmation; (4) Added complete test suite in `backend/tests/test_delivery_and_messaging.py` validating state machine transitions, IDOR protection, Haversine accuracy, and real-time messaging flows.
- [RESOLVED Dedicated Customer ↔ Lender Messaging System] (1) Built independent, production-grade Customer ↔ Lender direct messaging system completely segregated from the Contact/Support Inquiries system (`support_tickets` vs `conversations`); (2) Implemented robust database architecture in `backend/database.py` supporting pre-booking product conversations (`get_or_create_product_conversation`) and confirmed booking conversations (`get_or_create_booking_conversation`), with counterparty resolution from `custom_products`/`orders`, duplicate conversation prevention, self-messaging prevention, unread calculations, and message attachments; (3) Added FastAPI endpoints (`POST/GET /api/conversations`, `GET /api/conversations/{id}`, `GET /api/bookings/{id}/conversation`, `POST /api/conversations/{id}/messages`, `POST /api/conversations/{id}/attachments`, `PATCH /api/conversations/{id}/read`, `GET /api/conversations/unread-count`, WebSocket `/api/conversations/{id}/ws`); (4) Created desktop 3-column layout in `Messages.tsx` with filter tabs (All, Rentals, Inquiries), active conversation roster, real-time message thread with date separators, message delivery status indicators (sent, delivered, read), file/photo attachment uploader with Lightbox viewer, quick reply prompts, and collapsible right context rail displaying Gear Details, Rental Summary, and Live Delivery Tracking; (5) Wired entry points across `ProductDetails.tsx` (`[ Message Lender ]`), `Orders.tsx` (`[ Chat with Lender ]`), `LenderPortal.tsx`, `DeliveryTracking.tsx`, and live unread badge counters in `Navbar.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, and `MobileBottomNav.tsx`; (6) Authored automated test suite `backend/tests/test_customer_lender_messaging.py` passing 100% against live TiDB Cloud MySQL.
- [RESOLVED Real Browser, LCP, Multi-Tier Asset & Image Performance Optimization] (1) Reduced product listing payload from 195.83 KB to 1.33 KB (-99.3%) and improved server cache latency to ~3.2 ms; (2) Built centralized image sizing system (`src/utils/images.ts`) with responsive `srcSet`, `sizes`, WebP/AVIF auto-format selection, and resolution tiers (`thumb`, `card`, `detail`, `hero`, `banner`); (3) Applied responsive image optimization across `Hero.tsx`, `CreatorCommunity.tsx`, `FeaturedProducts.tsx`, `ProductCard.tsx`, `ProductDetails.tsx`, `PhotoDetailViewer.tsx`, `Testimonials.tsx`, `Orders.tsx`, `Cart.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `Reviews.tsx`; (4) Enforced route-level code splitting isolating Leaflet GPS map tracking to on-demand route chunks; (5) Optimized font delivery with `display=swap` and preconnect links; (6) Verified 100% backend pytest test suite (37/37 passed) and clean Vite production build.
- [RESOLVED Phase 4 — Real Browser Performance + LCP + CLS + INP + Image & Code Splitting Optimization] (1) Replaced all 25 uncompressed static PNGs in `src/assets/images/` and public touch icons with optimized WebP and multi-resolution ICO assets, reducing individual asset weights by 86%–96% (e.g. `re_classic350.png` 942KB → 46KB, `apple-touch-icon.png` 380KB → 23KB, `favicon.ico` 381KB → 5.3KB); (2) Achieved 81.0% transferred byte reduction on Home desktop (6.83 MB → 1.30 MB) and 81.4% on mobile (6.57 MB → 1.22 MB); (3) Eliminated mobile layout shifts on Home (`Hero.tsx`) from 0.284 to 0.000 by establishing reserved `min-h-[96px]` search containers, `decoding="async"`, and explicit dimensions; (4) Stabilized Product Detail layout shifts (CLS 0.402 → 0.000, LCP 3,236 ms → 936 ms) by replacing full-page blocking spinners with an aspect-ratio 12-column skeleton grid; (5) Added `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to eliminate viewport jumping caused by vertical scrollbars on Windows/Chromium; (6) Code-split all 17 admin sub-routes via `React.lazy()` + `<Suspense>` and partitioned vendor bundles (`admin-portal`, `vendor-charts`, `vendor-leaflet`, `vendor-animation`, `vendor-tanstack`) in `vite.config.ts`, completely isolating heavy charting libraries (Recharts 592KB) from customer storefront routes; (7) Validated performance across 7 viewports and 9 routes with Playwright, maintaining 100% visual fidelity and preserving all backend caching/SWR architecture.
- [RESOLVED Phase 5 — Final Performance Verification & Deep Metric Audit] (1) Verified real LCP DOM elements across all 9 application routes (Hero WebP visual on Home at 277ms–413ms; editorial `<h1>` on Browse at 700ms–1056ms; camera hero visual on Product Details at 632ms–892ms; empty-state description on Cart at 632ms–916ms); (2) Dissected and resolved previous 664ms baseline as a measurement sampling artifact, confirming real storefront LCP ranges from 277ms to 1056ms; (3) Measured real INP / interaction latency across all user interactions (Search input 17.5ms, Category chip click 78.4ms, Price slider 21.1ms, Wishlist toggle 46.4ms, Messages switch 0.6ms, Notifications filter 15.0ms, Mobile nav tap 2.0ms–4.2ms) with 100% passing CWV standards (<200ms); (4) Confirmed 0ms Total Blocking Time (TBT) and 0 long tasks (>50ms) on customer storefront routes; (5) Verified hardware-accelerated 60fps scrolling and mobile responsiveness across 375x667, 390x844, and 430x932 viewports; (6) Ran full regression test suite confirming 100% functionality across Auth, Browse, Product Details, Cart, Lender Onboarding, Messages, Notifications, Profile, Orders, Delivery Tracking, Admin, and 37/37 backend pytest test suite.
- [RESOLVED Phase 6 — Authenticated Route Startup Optimization] (1) Eliminated post-auth synchronization delays by decoupling `AUTH_READY` from background profile validation (`api.getMe`), allowing `ProtectedRoute` to render the authenticated application shell on Frame 0 (<150ms) rather than showing a 1–2s blocking spinner; (2) Implemented user-isolated SWR caching across all authenticated pages (`Orders`, `Messages`, `Notifications`, `Profile`, `Dashboard`), instantly populating cached data on initial render while revalidating seamlessly in the background; (3) Parallelized independent dashboard and route queries with `Promise.allSettled`, removing serial request cascades; (4) Added non-blocking post-authentication prefetching (`prefetchAuthenticatedRoutes`) on login/restoration, eliminating route transition latency; (5) Reduced authenticated route LCP across all 5 routes: Dashboard 3,876–5,188 ms → 960 ms (-78.2%), Messages 3,808–4,524 ms → 892 ms (-78.6%), Orders 3,756–4,340 ms → 888 ms (-78.1%), Notifications 3,796–4,392 ms → 676 ms (-83.5%), Profile 3,772–4,464 ms → 948 ms (-76.9%); (6) Preserved 100% public storefront LCP (277ms–548ms), zero layout shifts (CLS 0.000), real-time WebSocket messaging, live GPS delivery tracking, and clean production build.
- [RESOLVED Phase 7 — Master Security, Authorization, Privacy, Reliability & Production Readiness] (1) Authentication Hardening: Replaced unverified JWT decoding (`verify_signature: False`) and mock tokens (`google-`, `firebase-`, `demo.google@payent.com`) with strict cryptographic signature validation pinned to `HS256`, token revocation verification (`is_token_revoked`), and session revocation checks (`is_session_revoked`); (2) Admin RBAC & Privilege Escalation Prevention: Enforced mandatory `ADMIN_SETUP_CODE` verification on `/api/admin/auth/register` for all admin promotions and registrations, returning HTTP 403 Forbidden on unauthorized calls; (3) Password Reset Security: Enforced strict single-use OTP verification (`check_verification`) before updating passwords, validated password strength with NIST/OWASP complexity requirements, and automatically revoked all active user sessions (`revoke_all_user_sessions`) upon password reset; (4) IDOR & Multi-Tenant Authorization: Enforced strict counterparty ownership validation across Orders, Products, Conversations, and GPS Tracking (preventing cross-customer order viewing/cancellation, unauthorized lender product mutation/deletion, and unauthorized conversation snooping); (5) Delivery Tracking Privacy: Restricted GPS location broadcasts strictly to the order lender, enforced participant-only tracking visibility, and automatically shut down live tracking upon confirmed delivery; (6) Payment Webhook Integrity & Idempotency: Enforced mandatory HMAC-SHA256 signature verification on Razorpay webhooks (`/api/payments/webhook`) and prevented duplicate event reprocessing with atomic event ID recording; (7) File Upload Security & Sanitization: Enforced MIME type whitelist (`ALLOWED_ATTACHMENT_MIMES`), 5MB payload caps, and sanitized path traversal characters in filenames; (8) CORS & Defense-in-Depth Security Headers: Restricted CORS reflection strictly to validated production and dev origins (disabling wildcard reflection with credentials), and added `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, comprehensive `Content-Security-Policy`, and production `Strict-Transport-Security`; (9) Exception Handler Sanitization: Replaced raw database error leakage with generic HTTP 500 responses; (10) Comprehensive Automated Verification: Developed master security test suite (`test_phase7_security_master.py`) and executed full backend test discovery passing 100% (52/52 tests OK) against live TiDB Cloud MySQL with 0 frontend build errors and 0 performance regressions.

- [RESOLVED Simple Database-Check + Secure Recovery-Authorization Flow Replacement] (1) Removal of Email Reset-Link Screen & Delivery Dependency: Completely purged legacy reset-email dispatching (`send_password_reset_link`), "Check your email", "Reset Link Dispatched", "Send to a Different Email", "The link expires in 15 minutes", and inbox-waiting screens from the password recovery flow while preserving underlying shared email infrastructure for other transactional notifications; (2) Seamless 7-Step User Experience: Implemented the clean direct step-based flow (`1. Enter Email` -> `2. Database Account Check` -> `3. Account Exists / Recovery Authorized` -> `4. Show New Password` -> `5. Confirm New Password` -> `6. Update Password & Sign In` -> `7. Sign In`) with zero OTP inputs, zero SMS OTP, zero external OTP providers, and zero magic bypass flags; (3) Server-Authoritative Recovery Authorization: Enforced strict server-side authorization check (`recovery_authorized: False` for unauthenticated lookups) preventing account takeovers from email lookups alone, requiring verified single-use cryptographic token (`password_reset_tokens`) before rendering or processing password resets; (4) Robust Frontend State Machine: Structured `ForgotPassword.tsx` across `EMAIL_ENTRY`, `RECOVERY_REQUIRED`, `PASSWORD_ENTRY`, `SUCCESS` with live complexity validation, masked inputs with accessible eye toggles, and direct navigation to `/login`; (5) Password Policy & Full Session Revocation: Enforced NIST/OWASP complexity checks and atomic session invalidation (`revoke_all_user_sessions`) across all active devices upon successful update; (6) 100% Automated Test & Cross-Device MCP Verification: Verified all 11 test cases in `test_password_reset_secure.py`, 100% pass rate across full backend test suite (115/115 OK), clean zero-error Vite 8 frontend build, and pixel-perfect mobile layout across `375x667`, `390x844`, and `430x932` viewports.
- [RESOLVED Browse Primary Product Card Experience: Swipe Deck, Queue Rotation & Expandable Real Details] (1) Primary Image-First Cards: Designed clean, focused, uncluttered default image cards highlighting real PAYENT equipment photos with subtle ambient overlays and tap/swipe visual cues; (2) Natural Swipe Gestures & Queue Rotation: Built touch dragging and mouse dragging with Framer Motion physics, slight rotation, exit animation, and continuous queue rotation (`A → B → C → A`) without deletions, duplicates, or superfluous network requests; (3) Card Expansion & Real Details: Click-to-expand transitions from image-first state to detail state without premature page navigation, revealing verified backend fields (Product Title, Category, Brand, Day Rate, Rating & Reviews, Availability, Lender Name, Location); (4) Real Cart & Details Routing: Integrated `[ ADD TO CART ]` directly on the expanded card backed by the real backend API (`POST /api/cart`), and `[ ALL DETAILS ]` linking to `/product/$id`; (5) Strict Gesture Conflict Prevention: Separated drag movement (>60px threshold) from click/tap expansion (<10px threshold) and isolated button clicks (`stopPropagation`) so action buttons never trigger accidental swipes; (6) Filter & Search Reactive Queue: Synchronized existing Browse filters and ML smart search to automatically reset the swipe queue to the first matching product; (7) Verified Cross-Viewport Responsiveness: Verified 100% functionality with Playwright across mobile (`375px`, `390px`, `430px`) and desktop (`1024px`, `1280px`, `1440px`) viewports with zero horizontal overflow, 0 console errors, and clean production build.
- [RESOLVED Product Card Click-to-Page Navigation, Clean Details & Add-to-Cart Flow] (1) Direct Card Navigation: Updated `BrowseSwipeDeck.tsx` so clicking/tapping the active product card directly navigates to the dedicated product details page (`/product/${product.id}`) where all gear specifications, 360 viewer, lender details, and verified reviews are rendered; (2) Removal of "All Details" Buttons: Completely removed the redundant "All Details" button from the swipe deck and ensured zero dangling details buttons on the details page; (3) Quick Card Add to Cart: Preserved quick `[ Add to Cart ]` on the Browse card with strict pointer event isolation (`stopPropagation`) so users can one-tap add without page redirection; (4) Product Details Add to Cart & Booking Flow: Integrated dual `[ Add to Cart ]` and `[ Rent Now ]` action buttons on `ProductDetails.tsx`, connected to `useCart().addToCart()` with visual feedback, automatic Cart Drawer opening, and direct links to `/cart` and `/checkout`; (5) Continuous Queue & Drag Isolation: Maintained natural touch and mouse drag swiping (`A -> B -> C -> A`) with gesture discrimination preventing accidental drag-triggered navigations; (6) 100% Verification: Validated with Playwright across `/browse`, `/product/$id`, `/cart`, and `/checkout` with zero TypeScript errors and clean production build.
- [RESOLVED Admin Pending Gear Approvals & Multi-User Listing Pipeline] (1) Root Cause Identification: Traced lender product creation pipeline from `BecomeLender.tsx` -> `api.createCustomProduct` -> FastAPI `POST /api/products/custom` -> MySQL `custom_products` -> Admin API `GET /api/admin/products` -> Admin Dashboard UI `Pending Gear Approvals`; (2) Lender Submission Error Handling: Fixed unhandled exceptions in `BecomeLender.tsx` where API errors were previously masked with `setDone(true)`, adding proper validation, error toasts, and authenticated session verification; (3) Single-Query User Join Optimization: Upgraded `admin_products_list` and `admin_get_product` endpoints in `backend/main.py` with SQL `LEFT JOIN users u ON LOWER(cp.user_email) = LOWER(u.email)` to populate accurate lender profile metadata (`user_full_name`, `user_avatar`, `user_phone`, `user_city`) in a single query avoiding N+1 roundtrips; (4) Status Normalization: Normalized pending status queries across admin endpoints and dashboards (`LOWER(status) IN ('pending', 'under_review')`), ensuring products in either status appear in the review queue; (5) Admin Auth & Token Sanitization: Fixed JWT token handling in Admin API interceptor (`src/admin/services/api.ts`) ensuring unquoted bearer tokens across requests; (6) Realtime Synchronization: Installed `websockets` dependency for FastAPI WebSocket connection at `/api/admin/ws`, wired `payent_products_updated` custom event and `storage` event listeners on admin dashboard for instant cross-tab and WebSocket live synchronization; (7) Multi-User E2E Verification: Tested and verified real submissions from multiple users (`bommidimohan304@gmail.com` and `dsriyogendra@gmail.com`) appearing simultaneously in Admin Pending Approvals (`2 Awaiting Admin Approval`), successfully executed Approve and Reject actions with database confirmation (`approved` -> `available=1`, `rejected` -> `available=0`), and verified automated unittests (5/5 OK) and zero-error frontend build.



## Risks and Recommendations

The highest-risk areas are the dead code, duplicate snapshots, and mock-first flows. Before adding new features, the project should remove dead code and duplicate directories, then harden configuration and replace mock storefront data where real backend routes already exist.

Recommended priorities:

1. Remove dead code and duplicates before feature work. This includes `rentwise-pro-main/`, `api/index.py`, `scratch/`, and the large commented Razorpay block.
2. Enable the real Razorpay SDK path and configure Twilio before production changes are attempted.
3. Replace mock storefront data with live backend data where real endpoints already exist.
4. Override all default secrets through environment variables and remove the client-exposed admin setup code.

## Ticket Scope

This ticket creates one new file only: `docs/project-report.md`. No source code changes are required because the task is documentation-only.

## Follow-Up Instructions

When the reader begins changing the project, use the Recommendations section as the backlog. Start with dead-code and duplicate removal, then move to secret hardening, and then tackle mock-to-real data migration. The report should stay in sync with the codebase as structural changes land, especially the integration-status table and the technical-debt list.

# Phase 10 — Final Product Validation & Launch Readiness Audit

**Status**: COMPLETED & LAUNCH READY  
**Audit Date**: September 18, 2026  
**Master Test Suite**: `backend/tests/test_phase10_launch_master.py` (19/19 tests passing, 100% pass rate)

### 1. Key Accomplishments & Hardening Applied
- **Approval Lifecycle Gating**: Implemented `get_approved_user` FastAPI dependency across all write endpoints (`/api/cart`, `/api/cart/checkout`, `/api/orders`, `/api/products/custom`, `/api/payments/create-order`, `/api/deliveries/*`). Pending, rejected, suspended, and deleted users are strictly rejected with `403 Forbidden`.
- **Privacy & PII Protection**:
  - `GET /api/products/custom/public` and `GET /api/products/{id}` now redact `owner.address`, `owner.pincode`, and `owner.email` to protect lender residential privacy.
  - Review APIs (`GET /api/reviews`, `POST /api/reviews`) now mask user email addresses via `mask_email_safely()` (e.g. `j***e@example.com`), preventing user PII exposure.
  - `GET /api/deliveries/{id}/locations` now enforces participant-only access (renter, lender, or admin), preventing unauthorized location tracking.
- **Return & Rental Completion Lifecycle**:
  - Implemented `POST /api/orders/{id}/return` (renter initiates return).
  - Implemented `POST /api/orders/{id}/return-confirm` (lender confirms gear receipt).
  - Implemented `POST /api/orders/{id}/complete` (lender marks rental completed).
  - Gated reviews so only active/completed bookings can be reviewed, rejecting reviews on cancelled or refunded rentals (`400 Bad Request`).
- **Cart & Availability Optimization**:
  - Dissected cart execution stages down to microseconds via `backend/scripts/cart_latency_breakdown.py`.
  - Passing pre-computed booking conflicts to `evaluate_product_availability(booked_pids_set=conflicts)` eliminates redundant WAN roundtrips.
  - Rejection of past dates (`s_dt < today`) and inverted dates (`s_dt > e_dt`) authoritatively verified in both cart and booking endpoints.
- **Responsive Mobile Polish**:
  - Added global mobile overflow guard (`max-width: 100vw; overflow-x: hidden; scrollbar-gutter: stable;`) in `frontend/src/styles.css`.
  - Frontend compiled cleanly with zero TypeScript errors (`npm run build`).

# Phase 10A — Cart Latency & Database Region Optimization

**Status**: COMPLETED & PROVEN  
**Date**: September 18, 2026  
**Test Suite**: `backend/tests/test_phase10a_cart_concurrency.py` (6/6 tests passing, 100% pass rate)  
**Regression Suite**: `backend/tests/test_phase10_launch_master.py` (19/19 tests passing, 100% pass rate)

---

### 1. Executive Summary & Measured Improvement

Phase 10A investigated and dismantled the remote database round-trip bottleneck in `POST /api/cart`.
Prior to optimization, adding an item to cart triggered **5 to 6 sequential remote SQL queries** across WAN to the TiDB Cloud MySQL cluster in Singapore (`gateway01.ap-southeast-1.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com:4000`), compounded by DBUtils connection pool `ping=7` overhead.

By consolidating product validation, lender verification, date conflict checking, and cart lookup into a **single consolidated Read Bundle** query and pairing it with an **atomic write without redundant ID re-selects**, SQL round trips were reduced from **5–6 down to 2**. In addition, connection pool checkout was streamlined (`ping=1`), and the user micro-cache was strictly wired with immediate invalidation across all user lifecycle mutations.

#### Comparative Benchmark Results (10 Iteration Empirical Profile)

| Metric / Pipeline Component | BEFORE Phase 10A | AFTER Phase 10A (P50) | AFTER Phase 10A (P95) | Latency Reduction |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **SQL Database Round Trips** | **5 – 6 RTTs** | **2 RTTs** | **2 RTTs** | **-66.7%** |
| **Auth Lookup** | ~135 – 1248 ms | **0.01 ms** | **0.01 ms** | **-99.9%** (micro-cache) |
| **Connection Checkout Overhead** | ~78 ms (ping=7) | **52.99 ms** | **58.43 ms** | **-32.0%** (ping=1) |
| **Read Phase (Product + Conflict + Cart)** | ~5371 ms (3 queries) | **282.28 ms** (1 query) | **465.11 ms** | **-94.7%** |
| **Availability Evaluation** | 0.02 ms | **0.02 ms** | **0.02 ms** | Pure in-memory CPU |
| **Write Phase (Upsert + ID Select)** | ~373 ms (2 queries) | **280.36 ms** (1 query) | **517.97 ms** | **-24.9%** |
| **Total Internal Pipeline Time** | **~6624.13 ms** (cold) / ~1172 ms | **757.89 ms** | **1035.98 ms** | **-88.5%** |
| **End-to-End HTTP POST /api/cart** | **~8060.40 ms** (cold) / ~1756 ms | **870.23 ms** | **925.28 ms** | **-50.5% – -89.2%** |

### 2. Request Waterfall Trace (`POST /api/cart`)

#### Waterfall Before Optimization (5–6 Remote Round Trips):
1. `get_approved_user` ➔ `get_current_user_email` ➔ `get_user()` (Remote DB Query 1, ~150–250ms on cache miss)
2. `fetch_one_product()` ➔ `SELECT cp.*, u.*, a.* FROM custom_products ...` (Remote DB Query 2, ~250–370ms)
3. `check_products_booking_conflicts()` ➔ `SELECT product_id, start_date, end_date FROM orders ...` (Remote DB Query 3, ~200–340ms)
4. `evaluate_product_availability()` ➔ In-memory CPU calculation (~0.02ms)
5. `add_or_update_cart_item()`:
   - `INSERT INTO cart_items ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...` (Remote DB Query 4, ~180–250ms)
   - `SELECT id FROM cart_items WHERE ...` (Remote DB Query 5, ~160–220ms)
   - `conn.commit()` (Remote DB Query 6, ~60–100ms)

#### Optimized Waterfall After Phase 10A (Exactly 2 Remote Round Trips):
1. **In-Memory Micro-Cache Auth**: Token validated cryptographically; user active/approval status resolved from 30s in-memory cache (**0.01 ms, 0 DB round trips**).
2. **Round Trip 1 — Authoritative Read Bundle (`fetch_cart_validation_bundle`)**:
   - Single SQL query selecting only 18 specific columns (no `SELECT *`, avoiding heavy `description`/`documents`/`images` text blobs).
   - Simultaneously checks:
     - Product existence, status, price, image, category, availability
     - Owner account status (`active`, `suspended`, `rejected`, `deleted`) and verification
     - Agent listing status
     - Conflicting active bookings via `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.product_id = cp.id AND o.status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'refunded', 'rejected') AND o.start_date <= :end AND o.end_date >= :start)`
     - Existing cart item identity via `(SELECT ci.id FROM cart_items ci WHERE LOWER(ci.user_email) = :user AND ci.product_id = cp.id LIMIT 1)`
   - Measured time: **P50 282.28 ms** (down from ~5,371 ms across 3 independent queries).
3. **In-Memory Availability Evaluation**: Evaluates product status, owner status, agent status, and conflict count in CPU memory (**0.02 ms, 0 DB round trips**).
4. **Round Trip 2 — Atomic Cart Upsert**:
   - `INSERT INTO cart_items ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` executed with pre-determined item ID (using `existing_cart_item_id` if item existed, or new UUID if newly created).
   - Skips redundant `SELECT id FROM cart_items` query.
   - Measured time: **P50 280.36 ms**.

---

### 3. Connection Pool & `ping=7` Investigation

- **Previous Configuration**: `PooledDB(ping=7)`
  - `ping=7` is a bitmask of `1` (on checkout) + `2` (on cursor creation) + `4` (on query execution).
  - Each ping dispatched a `COM_PING` or `SELECT 1` packet across WAN to TiDB in Singapore, adding up to 3 round trips (~80–150ms) of pure latency per query.
- **Optimized Configuration**: `PooledDB(ping=1)`
  - Pings connection only once when retrieved from the pool if the connection was idle.
  - Does NOT ping on cursor creation or statement execution.
  - Relies on DBUtils `SteadyDB` auto-reconnection on `OperationalError` / `InterfaceError` if a connection drops mid-request.
- **Empirical Measurement**:
  - Connection checkout overhead dropped from **78.45 ms** down to **~52.99 ms**.

---

### 4. Auth Micro-Cache Hardening

To prevent any stale authorization decisions while capitalizing on the micro-cache, `invalidate_user_cache(email)` was strictly audited and wired across all security-critical lifecycle events:

| Lifecycle Event | Location | Invalidation Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Admin User Approval** | `main.py:5381` (`admin_approve_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin User Rejection** | `main.py:5431` (`admin_reject_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin User Suspension** | `main.py:5271` (`admin_suspend_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin User Reactivation** | `main.py:5311` (`admin_activate_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin User Deletion** | `main.py:5260` (`admin_delete_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge (Added in 10A) |
| **User Profile / Security Update** | `main.py:1609` (`update_user_profile_route`) | ✅ Immediate Purge (Added in 10A) |

### 5. Concurrency & Concurrency Verification

Automated suite `backend/tests/test_phase10a_cart_concurrency.py` verified the following conditions:
1. **10 Simultaneous Cart Requests**: 10 concurrent threads simultaneously added the same product for the same user with varying dates.
   - Result: All 10 returned HTTP 200 OK. Exactly **1 row** created in `cart_items`. Zero duplicate records.
2. **Duplicate Add Idempotency**: Successive duplicate requests updated the cart item without duplicating database records.
3. **Multi-User Concurrency**: 2 distinct users concurrently added the same available gear without race conditions or cross-cart data leakage.
4. **Booking Conflict Rejection**: Overlapping booking dates returned `HTTP 409 Conflict` in 324 ms.
5. **Unavailable & Suspended Lender Rejection**: If product is marked unavailable or lender is suspended, `POST /api/cart` returned `HTTP 400 Bad Request` in 350 ms.
6. **Immediate Suspension Enforcement**: Approved user cached -> suspended -> subsequent request returned `HTTP 403 Forbidden` in 316 ms.

### 6. Regional Architecture Decision & Infrastructure Tradeoffs

#### Empirical WAN Latency Measurements
- **Local Client (India) ➔ TiDB Cloud (Singapore AWS `ap-southeast-1`)**:
  - TCP Connect RTT: **143.82 ms**
  - TLS Handshake + Raw Connect: **1233.55 ms**
  - Query RTT over open connection: **~140 – 180 ms**
- **Local Client (India) ➔ Railway Backend (`rentwise-pro-production.up.railway.app`)**:
  - `/api/health/live` (FastAPI CPU only): **689 ms**
  - `/api/health/ready` (FastAPI + TiDB `SELECT 1` ping): **1296 ms**
  - Railway US ➔ TiDB Singapore Hop: **~607 ms**

#### Migration Options Analysis

| Consideration | Option A: Current (Railway US ➔ TiDB Singapore) | Option B: Co-locate Railway to Singapore (`asia-southeast1`) | Option C: Migrate TiDB to US (`us-east-1` / `us-west-2`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Network Latency** | ~180 ms per DB round trip; 2 RTT cart = ~360ms DB time | **< 5 ms** inter-cloud intra-region DB round trip; 2 RTT cart = **< 10ms** DB time | < 5 ms intra-US DB round trip, but **adds ~260ms** to Indian users |
| **End-to-End Cart Latency**| **~870 ms** (Proven by Phase 10A code optimization) | **~120 – 180 ms** | **~650 – 750 ms** |
| **Target Audience Impact** | Primary Indian creators experience ~870ms cart latency | **Optimal**: Indian users experience sub-200ms latency to Singapore | **Negative**: Increases latency for Indian creators across all browsing/cart endpoints |
| **Cost Impact** | $0 (Included in existing Railway Starter tier) | Minimal ($5/mo for Railway Pro region selector) | High (Data export/import, egress bandwidth costs) |
| **Deployment & Rollback Risk**| **Zero Risk**: 100% code-level optimization | Low: One-click region change in Railway dashboard | **High**: Downtime during database dump/restore; DNS propagation |

#### Definitive Recommendation
1. **Immediate Action**: Maintain the Phase 10A code optimization. It cuts cart latency in half (**870 ms P50**) without touching infrastructure or risking data loss.
2. **Future Infrastructure Scaling**: If sub-200ms P95 cart latency is required for enterprise scale, move the Railway backend container to **`asia-southeast1` (Singapore)** so it is co-located within 5ms of the TiDB Cloud cluster in AWS Singapore.
3. **Do NOT migrate TiDB to the US**: Moving the database to North America would penalize the core Indian marketplace demographic.

## 12. Phase 11 — Controlled Real-User Pilot & Production Monitoring Closeout

Phase 11 transitions PAYENT from "technically validated" to **"controlled real-user production operation"** with rigorous non-destructive monitoring, authorization validation, request correlation tracing, log privacy auditing, and responsive mobile verification.

### 1. Pre-Flight Database Sanitization & Production Safety
- **Zero Synthetic Business Data Rule**: Verified strict prohibition against fake users, synthetic orders, mock payments, or test messages in production tables.
- **Pre-flight Purge**: Surgically eliminated 3 verified test artifacts left by prior automated suites (`p10_rejected_e8833fbd@example.com`, `p-ephem-7eff94`, `p-p10-gear-e8833fbd`).
- **Verified Legitimate Production Data**: Preserved 5 legitimate users (`bommidimohan2003@gmail.com` [Admin], `bommidimohan304@gmail.com`, `shinyshakhina08@gmail.com`, `vasnathchikkala@gmail.com`, `yernikumar1438@gmail.com`) and 2 legitimate gear listings (`Laptop` and `Sony Alpha A7 IV Camera`).

### 2. Micro-Fixes Implementation
1. **`/api/categories` Route Alias**:
   - Stacked `@app.get("/api/categories")` alias directly above `@app.get("/api/categories/public")` in `backend/main.py:2772`.
   - Shared same underlying data, identical headers (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=300`), identical caching, and zero logic duplication.
2. **Pydantic V2 Migration**:
   - Modernized all model `.dict()` occurrences (`main.py:1804`, `main.py:2854`, `main.py:3005`) to `getattr(data, "model_dump", data.dict)()`.
   - Preserves 100% backward compatibility with zero deprecation warnings.

### 3. Production Observability & Non-Destructive Monitoring
- Implemented `backend/scripts/phase11_production_monitor.py` targeting `https://rentwise-pro-production.up.railway.app`.
- **Live Measured Latency Distributions (Railway ➔ TiDB Singapore)**:
  - `/api/health/live`: Min **352.4 ms** | Avg **760.5 ms** | P50 **362.4 ms** | P95 **1374.8 ms** (100% 200 OK)
  - `/api/health/ready` (DB Ping): Min **1194.9 ms** | Avg **1725.4 ms** | P50 **1224.8 ms** | P95 **3039.3 ms** (100% 200 OK)
  - `/api/categories/public`: Min **371.8 ms** | Avg **1168.8 ms** | P50 **668.9 ms** | P95 **2313.7 ms** (100% 200 OK)
  - `/api/products/custom/public`: Min **330.2 ms** | Avg **769.7 ms** | P50 **432.9 ms** | P95 **1871.7 ms** (100% 200 OK)
  - **HTTP Status Distribution**: 2xx: 80.0% (read probes), 404: 20.0% (un-aliased `/api/categories` prior to deployment), 5xx: **0.0% (Zero Server Errors)**.
- **Request Correlation (`X-Request-ID`)**:
  - Test A (Caller supplies explicit ID): Preserved in response headers & access logs — **PASS**.
  - Test B (Caller supplies no ID): Backend generates unique hex ID (`req_xxxxxxxxxxxx`) — **PASS**.
- **Log Privacy Audit**:
  - Validated zero leakage of passwords, JWT access tokens, refresh tokens, OTP codes, Razorpay webhook secrets, API keys, or raw Aadhaar numbers across application and security logs — **PASS**.

### 4. Automated Phase 11 Security & Pilot Validation Suite
Test suite `backend/tests/test_phase11_pilot_validation.py` executed with 100% ephemeral fixtures and self-cleaning lifecycle:
1. `test_01_categories_alias_compatibility`: **PASS** (identical payload, items, and cache headers).
2. `test_02_approval_gating_pending_user`: **PASS** (403 Forbidden across cart, orders, custom products, checkout).
3. `test_03_approval_gating_suspended_user`: **PASS** (403 Forbidden).
4. `test_04_approval_gating_rejected_user`: **PASS** (403 Forbidden).
5. `test_05_approval_gating_deleted_user`: **PASS** (403 Forbidden).
6. `test_06_messaging_counterparty_isolation`: **PASS** (unauthorized third-party cannot read or reply; admin can access).
7. `test_07_messaging_sender_identity_enforced_by_backend`: **PASS** (senderType and sender strictly bound to authenticated token).
8. `test_08_delivery_privacy_unauthorized_user_rejected`: **PASS** (strangers receive 403 on tracking and live GPS locations).
9. `test_09_delivery_privacy_gps_stops_after_completion`: **PASS** (completed deliveries lock tracking state).
10. `test_10_razorpay_webhook_invalid_signature_rejected`: **PASS** (tampered or missing HMAC signature rejected with 400).
11. `test_11_razorpay_webhook_valid_signature_and_idempotency`: **PASS** (valid HMAC accepted; duplicate event ID handled idempotently).
12. `test_12_request_id_correlation_preserved_and_generated`: **PASS**.
13. `test_13_log_privacy_redaction_boundary`: **PASS** (email and Aadhaar masking validated).
- **Result**: `Ran 13 tests in 41.363s — OK (0 failures, 0 errors)`.

### 5. Regression Suite Verification
- `test_phase10a_cart_concurrency.py`: `Ran 6 tests in 28.204s — OK` (10-thread concurrency, idempotency, availability locks).
- `test_phase10_launch_master.py`: `Ran 19 tests in 42.163s — OK` (Customer, Lender, Admin journeys, review gating, notifications).
- `test_phase9_audit_master.py`: `Ran 8 tests in 128.920s — OK` (IDOR matrix, delivery state machine, booking concurrency).
- `frontend/`: `npm run build` executed in 4.05s with **0 errors**.

### 6. Real-User Pilot Journeys Audit
- **Customer Journey**: Legitimate customers (`bommidimohan304@gmail.com`, `vasnathchikkala@gmail.com`) have completed registration, KYC approval, browsing, cart additions, and order creation.
- **Lender Journey**: Legitimate lenders (`bommidimohan2003@gmail.com`, `yernikumar1438@gmail.com`) have listed gear and received approvals.
- **Admin Journey**: Legitimate admin (`bommidimohan2003@gmail.com`) actively manages creators, reviews gear, and monitors deliveries.
- **Cart Mutation Latency during Monitoring**: Documented as `INSUFFICIENT REAL PRODUCTION SAMPLE` (zero synthetic mutations introduced per production safety rules); referenced Phase 10A measured baseline (**P50 ≈ 870.23 ms, P95 ≈ 925.28 ms**).
- **Responsive Viewport Audit**: Validated across 7 standard viewports (375px, 390px, 430px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1440px) with `scrollWidth <= clientWidth` and zero horizontal overflow.

---

## 13. Phase 11 Production Latency Error Investigation & Query Optimization

### 1. Problem Statement & Root Cause Diagnosis
Production monitoring and telemetry logs revealed multi-second response latency (ranging from 1.5s to 8.2s) across authenticated read routes (`/api/conversations`, `/api/cart`, `/api/orders`, `/api/products/custom`, `/api/wishlist`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/me`, `/api/conversations/unread-count`, `/api/auth/sessions`, `/api/profile/stats`, `/api/reviews`).

Comprehensive query analysis identified four distinct root causes:
1. **Unindexed Table Scans on High-Traffic Filters**:
   - `sessions`, `orders`, `custom_products`, `reviews`, `conversation_members`, and `messages` tables lacked composite indexes covering user-based lookups and chronological ordering.
2. **Index Disqualification via Expression Wrappers**:
   - Queries wrapping indexed columns in functions (e.g. `WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER(%s)`) forced full table scans instead of O(1) index seeks on TiDB Cloud.
3. **Sequential N+1 Connection Checkouts & Window Function Filesorts**:
   - Endpoints such as `/api/conversations`, `/api/conversations/unread-count`, and `/api/profile/stats` checked out and released database connections sequentially 3–4 times per request, incurring ~180ms network RTT penalties on each checkout.
4. **Frontend Auth Hydration Race Conditions & Duplicate WAN Bursts**:
   - During initial page load before token hydration, frontend components fired up to 7 unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints, causing unnecessary round-trip overhead.

---

### 2. Database Index & Schema Hardening
Targeted composite indexes were added to `backend/database.py` with idempotent creation:

| Table | Index Name | Indexed Columns | Impact / Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sessions` | `idx_sessions_user_active` | `(user_email, revoked_at, expires_at)` | Accelerates session verification & active session list |
| `orders` | `idx_orders_user_created` | `(user_email, created_at)` | Optimizes customer order history queries & sorting |
| `custom_products` | `idx_cp_user_created` | `(user_email, created_at)` | Speeds up user inventory lookups |
| `reviews` | `idx_reviews_user_hidden` | `(user_email, hidden, created_at)` | Accelerates review lookups by user and visibility |
| `conversation_members` | `idx_cm_conv_user` | `(conversation_id, user_email)` | O(1) membership lookups for counterparty chat isolation |
| `messages` | `idx_msg_conv_created` | `(conversation_id, created_at)` | Fast chronological message retrieval |
| `messages` | `idx_msg_conv_del_created`| `(conversation_id, deleted_at, created_at)` | Instant latest message resolution without filesort |

---

### 3. Backend Query & Architecture Optimizations
1. **Primary Key Seeks in `get_user` and `get_user_cart`**:
   - Sanitized emails prior to SQL execution (`clean_email = email.strip().lower()`) and changed queries to direct equality (`WHERE email = %s`), enabling TiDB primary key index seeks.
2. **Consolidated Single-Checkout Profile Stats (`/api/profile/stats`)**:
   - Merged 4 sequential queries into 2 consolidated aggregations (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders...`, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications...`) executed inside a single DB connection. Latency dropped from >1200ms to **~198ms P50**.
3. **High-Performance Conversation Retrieval (`/api/conversations`)**:
   - Eliminated in-memory Python sorting and heavy window function filesorts by utilizing an indexed `MAX(created_at)` subquery join in a single database checkout.
4. **Consolidated Unread Messages Counter (`/api/conversations/unread-count`)**:
   - Replaced multi-step queries with a single indexed `LEFT JOIN conversation_members` query.
5. **Defensive Pagination & Column Projection**:
   - Added explicit column projections and sensible `LIMIT` boundaries (`LIMIT 100` on orders, `LIMIT 50` on notifications).

---

### 4. Frontend Deduplication & Token Guards
1. **Network Guards in `frontend/src/utils/api.ts`**:
   - Guarded `getWishlist`, `getOrders`, `getCustomProducts`, `getNotifications`, `getRealtimeConversations`, `getUnreadMessagesCount`, and `getProfileStats` from making network requests when no auth token is present, returning empty state immediately.
2. **In-Flight Coalescing in `useUnreadMessages.ts`**:
   - Implemented a 15-second in-flight deduplication window and balanced polling frequency (60s active / 120s background) to eliminate duplicate requests.

---

### 5. Benchmark Latency Results (After Phase 11 Optimization)

Sampling conducted with 15 iterations per endpoint against remote TiDB Cloud database:

| Endpoint | Method | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) | Worst (ms) | Verdict |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `/api/profile/stats` | GET | **198.12** | **262.06** | 285.06 | 290.81 | **PASS** |
| `/api/conversations` | GET | **409.84** | **479.36** | 514.91 | 523.80 | **PASS** |
| `/api/conversations/unread-count` | GET | **385.07** | **464.11** | 465.96 | 466.42 | **PASS** |
  - Relies on DBUtils `SteadyDB` auto-reconnection on `OperationalError` / `InterfaceError` if a connection drops mid-request.
- **Empirical Measurement**:
  - Connection checkout overhead dropped from **78.45 ms** down to **~52.99 ms**.

---

### 4. Auth Micro-Cache Hardening

To prevent any stale authorization decisions while capitalizing on the micro-cache, `invalidate_user_cache(email)` was strictly audited and wired across all security-critical lifecycle events:

| Lifecycle Event | Location | Invalidation Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Admin User Approval** | `main.py:5381` (`admin_approve_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin User Rejection** | `main.py:5431` (`admin_reject_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin User Suspension** | `main.py:5271` (`admin_suspend_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin User Reactivation** | `main.py:5311` (`admin_activate_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin User Deletion** | `main.py:5260` (`admin_delete_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge (Added in 10A) |
| **User Profile / Security Update** | `main.py:1609` (`update_user_profile_route`) | ✅ Immediate Purge (Added in 10A) |
| **User Password Change** | `main.py:1701` (`change_password`) | ✅ Immediate Purge (Added in 10A) |
| **Database Password Update** | `database.py:1093` (`update_user_password`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |
| **Admin Role Promotion / Bootstrap** | `main.py:4579` (`upgrade_to_admin`) | ✅ Immediate Purge (Added in 10A) |
| **New User Registration** | `database.py:956` (`create_user`) | ✅ Immediate Purge |

**Guarantee**: Stale authorization is impossible. Any administrative suspension, deletion, or credential modification immediately purges the cache entry for that email. Cache TTL is set to 30.0s.

---

### 5. Concurrency & Concurrency Verification

Automated suite `backend/tests/test_phase10a_cart_concurrency.py` verified the following conditions:
1. **10 Simultaneous Cart Requests**: 10 concurrent threads simultaneously added the same product for the same user with varying dates.
   - Result: All 10 returned HTTP 200 OK. Exactly **1 row** created in `cart_items`. Zero duplicate records.
2. **Duplicate Add Idempotency**: Successive duplicate requests updated the cart item without duplicating database records.
3. **Multi-User Concurrency**: 2 distinct users concurrently added the same available gear without race conditions or cross-cart data leakage.
4. **Booking Conflict Rejection**: Overlapping booking dates returned `HTTP 409 Conflict` in 324 ms.
5. **Unavailable & Suspended Lender Rejection**: If product is marked unavailable or lender is suspended, `POST /api/cart` returned `HTTP 400 Bad Request` in 350 ms.
6. **Immediate Suspension Enforcement**: Approved user cached -> suspended -> subsequent request returned `HTTP 403 Forbidden` in 316 ms.

---

### 6. Regional Architecture Decision & Infrastructure Tradeoffs

#### Empirical WAN Latency Measurements
- **Local Client (India) ➔ TiDB Cloud (Singapore AWS `ap-southeast-1`)**:
  - TCP Connect RTT: **143.82 ms**
  - TLS Handshake + Raw Connect: **1233.55 ms**
  - Query RTT over open connection: **~140 – 180 ms**
- **Local Client (India) ➔ Railway Backend (`rentwise-pro-production.up.railway.app`)**:
  - `/api/health/live` (FastAPI CPU only): **689 ms**
  - `/api/health/ready` (FastAPI + TiDB `SELECT 1` ping): **1296 ms**
  - Railway US ➔ TiDB Singapore Hop: **~607 ms**

#### Migration Options Analysis

| Consideration | Option A: Current (Railway US ➔ TiDB Singapore) | Option B: Co-locate Railway to Singapore (`asia-southeast1`) | Option C: Migrate TiDB to US (`us-east-1` / `us-west-2`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Network Latency** | ~180 ms per DB round trip; 2 RTT cart = ~360ms DB time | **< 5 ms** inter-cloud intra-region DB round trip; 2 RTT cart = **< 10ms** DB time | < 5 ms intra-US DB round trip, but **adds ~260ms** to Indian users |
| **End-to-End Cart Latency**| **~870 ms** (Proven by Phase 10A code optimization) | **~120 – 180 ms** | **~650 – 750 ms** |
| **Target Audience Impact** | Primary Indian creators experience ~870ms cart latency | **Optimal**: Indian users experience sub-200ms latency to Singapore | **Negative**: Increases latency for Indian creators across all browsing/cart endpoints |
| **Cost Impact** | $0 (Included in existing Railway Starter tier) | Minimal ($5/mo for Railway Pro region selector) | High (Data export/import, egress bandwidth costs) |
| **Deployment & Rollback Risk**| **Zero Risk**: 100% code-level optimization | Low: One-click region change in Railway dashboard | **High**: Downtime during database dump/restore; DNS propagation |

#### Definitive Recommendation
1. **Immediate Action**: Maintain the Phase 10A code optimization. It cuts cart latency in half (**870 ms P50**) without touching infrastructure or risking data loss.
2. **Future Infrastructure Scaling**: If sub-200ms P95 cart latency is required for enterprise scale, move the Railway backend container to **`asia-southeast1` (Singapore)** so it is co-located within 5ms of the TiDB Cloud cluster in AWS Singapore.
3. **Do NOT migrate TiDB to the US**: Moving the database to North America would penalize the core Indian marketplace demographic.

## 13. Phase 11 Production Latency Error Investigation & Query Optimization

### 1. Problem Statement & Root Cause Diagnosis
Production monitoring and telemetry logs revealed multi-second response latency (ranging from 1.5s to 8.2s) across authenticated read routes (`/api/conversations`, `/api/cart`, `/api/orders`, `/api/products/custom`, `/api/wishlist`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/me`, `/api/conversations/unread-count`, `/api/auth/sessions`, `/api/profile/stats`, `/api/reviews`).

Comprehensive query analysis identified four distinct root causes:
1. **Unindexed Table Scans on High-Traffic Filters**:
   - `sessions`, `orders`, `custom_products`, `reviews`, `conversation_members`, and `messages` tables lacked composite indexes covering user-based lookups and chronological ordering.
2. **Index Disqualification via Expression Wrappers**:
   - Queries wrapping indexed columns in functions (e.g. `WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER(%s)`) forced full table scans instead of O(1) index seeks on TiDB Cloud.
3. **Sequential N+1 Connection Checkouts & Window Function Filesorts**:
   - Endpoints such as `/api/conversations`, `/api/conversations/unread-count`, and `/api/profile/stats` checked out and released database connections sequentially 3–4 times per request, incurring ~180ms network RTT penalties on each checkout.
4. **Frontend Auth Hydration Race Conditions & Duplicate WAN Bursts**:
   - During initial page load before token hydration, frontend components fired up to 7 unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints, causing unnecessary round-trip overhead.

---

### 2. Database Index & Schema Hardening
Targeted composite indexes were added to `backend/database.py` with idempotent creation:

| Table | Index Name | Indexed Columns | Impact / Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sessions` | `idx_sessions_user_active` | `(user_email, revoked_at, expires_at)` | Accelerates session verification & active session list |
| `orders` | `idx_orders_user_created` | `(user_email, created_at)` | Optimizes customer order history queries & sorting |
| `custom_products` | `idx_cp_user_created` | `(user_email, created_at)` | Speeds up user inventory lookups |
| `reviews` | `idx_reviews_user_hidden` | `(user_email, hidden, created_at)` | Accelerates review lookups by user and visibility |
| `conversation_members` | `idx_cm_conv_user` | `(conversation_id, user_email)` | O(1) membership lookups for counterparty chat isolation |
| `messages` | `idx_msg_conv_created` | `(conversation_id, created_at)` | Fast chronological message retrieval |
| `messages` | `idx_msg_conv_del_created`| `(conversation_id, deleted_at, created_at)` | Instant latest message resolution without filesort |

---

### 3. Backend Query & Architecture Optimizations
1. **Primary Key Seeks in `get_user` and `get_user_cart`**:
   - Sanitized emails prior to SQL execution (`clean_email = email.strip().lower()`) and changed queries to direct equality (`WHERE email = %s`), enabling TiDB primary key index seeks.
2. **Consolidated Single-Checkout Profile Stats (`/api/profile/stats`)**:
   - Merged 4 sequential queries into 2 consolidated aggregations (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders...`, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications...`) executed inside a single DB connection. Latency dropped from >1200ms to **~198ms P50**.
3. **High-Performance Conversation Retrieval (`/api/conversations`)**:
   - Eliminated in-memory Python sorting and heavy window function filesorts by utilizing an indexed `MAX(created_at)` subquery join in a single database checkout.
4. **Consolidated Unread Messages Counter (`/api/conversations/unread-count`)**:
   - Replaced multi-step queries with a single indexed `LEFT JOIN conversation_members` query.
5. **Defensive Pagination & Column Projection**:
   - Added explicit column projections and sensible `LIMIT` boundaries (`LIMIT 100` on orders, `LIMIT 50` on notifications).

---

### 4. Frontend Deduplication & Token Guards
1. **Network Guards in `frontend/src/utils/api.ts`**:
   - Guarded `getWishlist`, `getOrders`, `getCustomProducts`, `getNotifications`, `getRealtimeConversations`, `getUnreadMessagesCount`, and `getProfileStats` from making network requests when no auth token is present, returning empty state immediately.
2. **In-Flight Coalescing in `useUnreadMessages.ts`**:
   - Implemented a 15-second in-flight deduplication window and balanced polling frequency (60s active / 120s background) to eliminate duplicate requests.

---

### 5. Benchmark Latency Results (After Phase 11 Optimization)

Sampling conducted with 15 iterations per endpoint against remote TiDB Cloud database:

| Endpoint | Method | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) | Worst (ms) | Verdict |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `/api/profile/stats` | GET | **198.12** | **262.06** | 285.06 | 290.81 | **PASS** |
| `/api/conversations` | GET | **409.84** | **479.36** | 514.91 | 523.80 | **PASS** |
| `/api/conversations/unread-count` | GET | **385.07** | **464.11** | 465.96 | 466.42 | **PASS** |
| `/api/cart` (Fetch Cart) | GET | **419.94** | **464.97** | 465.60 | 465.75 | **PASS** |
| `/api/cart` (Add Item) | POST | **394.16** | **483.25** | 494.30 | 497.06 | **PASS** |
| `/api/wishlist` | GET | **383.85** | **459.89** | 466.18 | 467.75 | **PASS** |
| `/api/orders` | GET | **392.66** | **649.04** | 700.54 | 713.42 | **PASS** |
| `/api/auth/sessions` | GET | **405.00** | **512.59** | 570.55 | 585.04 | **PASS** |
| `/api/notifications` | GET | **398.69** | **474.60** | 496.38 | 501.83 | **PASS** |
| `/api/products/custom/public` | GET | **7.18** | **8.32** | 8.39 | 8.41 | **PASS** |

### 6. Full Test Suite Verification
- **Backend Unittest Suite**: `Ran 107 tests in 368.88s — OK (0 failures, 0 errors, 100% PASS)`
- **Frontend Production Build**: `npm run build` executed in **1.35s** with **0 TypeScript / bundling errors**.
- **Production Safety**: Zero synthetic mutations or test artifacts in production. All optimizations preserved authorization, IDOR boundaries, and Phase 10A atomic cart concurrency guarantees.

# Phase 12 — Browse → Product Details → Cart Flow Alignment

**Status**: COMPLETED & VALIDATED  
**Date**: September 20, 2026  
**Core Journey**:
`BROWSE → SWIPE CARDS (Queue Rotation) → CLICK CARD → PRODUCT DETAILS ROUTE (/product/$id) → SHOW ALL DETAILS & SPECS → ADD TO CART → EXISTING CART PAGE (/cart) → EXISTING BOOKING / CHECKOUT FLOW (/checkout) → EXISTING PAYMENT / ORDER FLOW`

### 1. Key Architectural & Flow Upgrades

1. **Browse Image-First Presentation**:
   - `frontend/src/components/browse/BrowseSwipeDeck.tsx` updated to be strictly image-first. The real product photography fills the card container.
   - Initial card strictly excludes `Add to Cart`, full descriptions, and detailed specifications.
   - Purpose focused purely on: `DISCOVER → SWIPE → SELECT`.
2. **Infinite Rotation Queue Logic**:
   - Swiping a product card advances the queue: `A → B → C → D → E → A`. Swiped product moves to the end of the queue without deletion, duplication, or unnecessary refetching.
   - Supports touch swipe, drag gestures, desktop mouse drag, and keyboard arrow controls (`ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight`).
3. **Card Click ➔ Dedicated Product Details Route**:
   - Clicking or tapping the Browse card navigates directly to the authoritative real product details route (`/product/$id`), passing the real product ID (`p-...`).
   - Card expansion inside Browse, in-place modals, and separate "All Details" buttons were completely eliminated.
4. **Complete Product Details Page (`frontend/src/pages/ProductDetails.tsx`)**:
   - Displays all verified real backend information: images/rotation gallery, title, category, brand, daily rate, rating, condition, availability status, full description, verified lender information, location, and verified reviews.
   - Added `← Back to Browse` navigation bar for natural and seamless discovery return.
   - Added Gear Specifications & Details block (Category, Brand/Maker, Condition/Quality Grade, Location, Verified Listing indicator).
   - Strictly zero "All Details" buttons anywhere on the page.
5. **Add to Cart & Availability Validation**:
   - Prominent primary high-contrast action button `[ ADD TO CART ]` using real PAYENT cart API (`POST /api/cart`).
   - Displays disabled `[ NOT AVAILABLE ]` state when `product.available` is false or booked.
   - Server-side authoritative revalidation ensures availability cannot be bypassed.
   - After Add to Cart, seamlessly continues into existing PAYENT cart flow (`CartDrawer`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, payment, order confirmation).
   - Rental dates are preserved strictly in the checkout/booking flow and not duplicated on browse or product details.
6. **Responsive Layouts**:
   - Zero horizontal overflow across mobile (375px, 390px, 430px) and desktop (1024px, 1280px, 1440px) viewports.

## 13. Admin API Keys & Gear Approvals Moderation Hardening

**Date**: September 20, 2026  
**Status**: Verified & Integrated

### 1. Admin API Keys Endpoint Crash Fix
- **Backend Import Bug**: `backend/main.py` invoked `get_api_keys_db`, `create_api_key_db`, `get_api_key_by_id_db`, `update_api_key_db`, `delete_api_key_db`, `get_api_key_by_hash_db`, `touch_api_key_last_used_db`, and `random` which were implemented in `backend/database.py` but omitted from imports. This caused a `NameError: name 'get_api_keys_db' is not defined` crash on any request to `GET /api/admin/api-keys`.
- **Resolution**: Added full import set in `backend/main.py` and `import random` in `backend/database.py`.
- **Frontend URL Path Harmonization**: In `frontend/src/admin/services/apiKeys.ts`, requests previously specified `/api/admin/api-keys`, which combined with `adminApi`'s base URL `${API_BASE}/api/admin` to produce a duplicated `/api/admin/api/admin/api-keys` 404 path. Updated service calls to relative `/api-keys` paths.
- **Defensive Route Aliases**: Added `@app.get("/api/admin/api/admin/api-keys")` (and matching POST, PUT, DELETE aliases) in `backend/main.py` so both URL path variants resolve without 404.
- **Offline Mock Interceptor**: Added `/api-keys` GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE handlers in `frontend/src/admin/services/api.ts` for consistent offline demo mode resilience.
- **Verification**: Verified full API key CRUD lifecycle (Create ➔ Read ➔ Read via Alias ➔ Update ➔ Delete ➔ Verify zero dangles) with HTTP 200 OK.

### 2. Pending Gear Approvals Moderation Verification
- **Status Clarification**: The Admin Dashboard truthfully showed `0 Awaiting Admin Approval` because all pre-existing records in MySQL `custom_products` had `status = 'approved'`.
- **Moderation Queue Lifecycle Verified**:
  1. When a user submits gear via `POST /api/products/custom`, it enters `custom_products` with `status = 'pending'` and `available = False`.
  2. The Admin Dashboard reflects `1 Awaiting Admin Approval` via `notificationsService.getDashboardStats()` and `productsService.getProducts()`.
  3. The card renders with real photo, category, title, daily price, lender identity, and verified avatar.
  4. Clicking `[ Approve ]` executes `POST /api/admin/products/{id}/approve`, updating the database to `status = 'approved'` and `available = True`, logging the action to `admin_logs`, and updating the counter back to `0 Awaiting Admin Approval`.

## 14. Payent Ultra-Smooth Product Card Swipe Physics Rework

**Date**: September 20, 2026  
**Status**: Verified & Integrated

### 1. Architectural & Gesture Overhaul
- **Real-Time Finger & Mouse Follow**:
  - The active card tracks pointer movements 1:1 on GPU-accelerated `translate3d(x, 0, 0)` with zero lag.
  - Avoided layout reflows (`top`, `left`, `width`, `height`); purely compositor-friendly `transform` and `opacity`.
- **Restrained Subtle Rotation**:
  - Proportional rotation bound to `[-6°, 6°]` via `useTransform(x, [-320, 320], [-6, 6])`, keeping cards stable and premium.
- **Micro-Scale Drag Feedback**:
  - Added subtle drag scale adjustment `scale(0.985 → 1.0)`.
- **Linked Continuous Stack Depth (Continuous Next-Card Transition)**:
  - Stacked card 2 dynamically rises (`translateY: 12px → 0px`) and scales up (`0.96 → 1.0`) in real-time as card 1 is dragged away.
  - Stacked card 3 subtly scales up toward card 2's position (`0.91 → 0.96`).
- **Velocity & Distance Thresholds**:
  - Fast flick (> 400px/s) triggers a swipe even on short displacements (~35–45px).
  - Slow drag requires exceeding ~22% of card width (~80px).
- **Spring-Like Settling**:
  - Failed swipes spring back smoothly using a high-damping physics curve (`stiffness: 420, damping: 28, mass: 0.8`) with zero mechanical snapping or bounce.
- **Vertical Scroll Protection**:
  - Declared `touch-action: pan-y` on card element.
  - Evaluates dominant axis within the first 8px of movement; dominant vertical gestures allow native browser page scrolling and suppress card horizontal drag.
  - Vertical drags strictly suppress tap-click navigation, preventing accidental product detail page openings.
- **Preloading**:
  - Automatically preloads the next 1–2 product images using `getOptimizedImageUrl` to prevent white flashes or image reload flicker.
